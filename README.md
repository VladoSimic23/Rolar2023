## About Rolar Project
This project is used by company [Rolar](http://www.rolar.eu/). The goal of this project was to reduce the unnecessary time lost by hand calculations for each component of particular product. For example: If you have a 10 Blinds , and each of them is a different sizes (height and width). Blinds have 5 to 7 parts that need to be cut to a specific size and you have to calcualte every part manualy with a calculator. This approach used to lead to slow production time and increased possiblity of making mistake beacuse of manual calculations. Now, with predetermined parameters saved in the CMS system Sanity, the company no longer needs to worry about the accuracy of components for any product. All you have to concern yourself with is ensuring that the parameters are initially entered correctly.
The program is easy to use. After entering the customer's information, it is necessary to select the product, enter the height and width of the product requested by the customer, and other necessary parameters. After everything has been entered correctly, there is a box in the lower right corner of the application, which should be clicked in order to prepare a printout of the order. After that you just need to press ctrl + p and that's it. The original program is converted to [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and is used as a desktop app.

## About Project Setup
This project is built with the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Sanity IO](https://www.sanity.io/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

## Vite
Vite is a modern, opinionated build tool that is designed to be fast and lightweight. It is a next-generation build tool that replaces the traditional bundler used in most modern web development workflows. Vite provides an instant development server with hot module reloading, which allows developers to make changes to their code and see the results instantly in the browser. It also has built-in support for popular front-end frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte, and supports modern web development features such as ES Modules and dynamic imports. Vite is a popular choice for developers who want a fast, modern, and opinionated build tool for their front-end development workflow.

## Typescript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to improve the development experience, catch errors earlier, and make code more scalable and maintainable. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, allowing developers to use it in any environment that supports JavaScript.

## Sanity
